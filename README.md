# Firebase Data Type Mismatch Errors

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often tricky-to-debug, error in Firebase applications: data type mismatches.  When fetching data from the Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore, unexpected data types can cause crashes or unexpected application behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where data type validation is missing. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution that includes robust error handling and type checking to prevent such errors.

## How to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary credentials.
3.  Run `bug.js` to observe the error.
4.  Run `bugSolution.js` to see how type validation and error handling can prevent the error.
